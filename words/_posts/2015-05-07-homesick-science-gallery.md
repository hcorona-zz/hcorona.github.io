Last week I attended  to the launch of Science Gallery&#8217;s new exhibition, entitled  &#8220;HOME\SICK post domestic bliss&#8221;. Regulars from the Science Gallery events gathered to get the first view on this exhibition;  good music, nice atmosphere and a great exhibition that won&#8217;t dissapoint anyone.

HOME\SICK  &#8220;explores how our homes might be reconfigured and reimagined as centres of connection in spite of emigration, of intimacy in spite of digital distraction, of food and energy production rather than consumption&#8221;.

It was very interesting to see how the exhibition explores the concept of a home, what constitutes and what surrounds it and builds it. From the alergens and patogens that we find at home, to tools to make home a much better livable space, to stories of people&#8217;s home, and even a lighthouse! My favourite was a series of pieces that explore the concept of home for people who, like me, are regularly away from home, or from the people they consider home.
