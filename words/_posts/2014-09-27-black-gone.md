  Your pictures are gone,<br /> and so is my love,<br /> my friendship, my willingness.<br /> And so are all my failed efforts to evolve.<br /> gone, gone, gone!
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  The empty spaces are still there,<br /> they will never be filled,<br /> not with something else,<br /> not the same way,<br /> I don&#8217;t care, I have lived, loved and learned.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  The sorrow is gone, my memory flakes,<br /> soon this will be dead, buried in my head.<br /> I ain&#8217;t wearing black.
