    Eames: The Architect & The Painter (2011)
  </p>
</div>

[**Eames : The Architect & the painter** ][1] is one of the best movies about artists I saw last year, it documents very well the work and life of one of the most iconic industrial designers of the 20th century, and it portraits  how important the role of [Ray Eames][2] was in the whole creative process of the [Eames office][3].

Eames was a  couple of [modernist][4] artist who is most known for being the creator of some of the most popular chairs in the 20th century like the [Ottoman Lounge chair][5] (1956) or the [DSW plastic chair][6] (1950), mid century pieces that we can still see nowadays everywhere from homes, offices or restaurants. The vision of the studio was to bring good design to the masses, and they delivered it in form of furniture, photography, [film][7], or even toys like the [house of cards][8].

    Visual Acoustics (2008)
  </p>
</div>

**[Visual Acoustics][9]: the modernism of [Julius Schulman][10]** is a documentary film about the life of one of the most importan architectural photographers of the modernism movement. He photographed the most important architects while he lived: iconic structures from Frank Lloyd Wright, Richard Neutra, John Lautner, Frank Gehry or Eames, and he did it in a way that he brought modern architecture to the mainstream public.

Julius Schulman (1910 &#8211; 2009)  is one of the best architectural photographers that lived, and thru the film you get a sense of how important his work was to him and how passionate he was about it, up to the point that he stoped taking pictures (for a while) after once the[ post-modernism][11] movement started. His work is now preserved in the [getty  foundation][12] and he lived to see his work published by the well known art publishers [taschen][13].

    How Much Does Your Building Weights, Mr. Foster? (2010)
  </p>
</div>

How Much Does My Building Weights, Mr Foster? Is the documentary  that narrates the career of one of the most prominent architect nowadays. The film, produced by Elena Ochoa (who run, among many other things [IvoryPress][14], one of my favourite galleries in Madrid and also an editorial) portraits the result of a man&#8217;s hard work and passion for architecture.

[Lord Norman Foster][15] has a curriculum lists an endless number of buildings and prizes acomplished with his architectural studio [Foster&Partner][16]s.  He restored the [Reichstag][17] building in Berlin, designed  airports in Zagreb, Beijing, Hong Kong and London, or the [Torre Caja Madrid][18] in Spain, and yet the film shows a familiar and ordinary man who is not extremely interesting in his daily basis life (or at least that&#8217;s the image the film portraits).
