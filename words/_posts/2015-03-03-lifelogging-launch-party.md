Last Thursday I attended the launch party for the [Science Gallery&#8217;s][1] upcoming exhibition entitled [#LIFELOGGING.][2]   Let me first put this into context. The science gallery is one of my favourite museums in the world, and definetly one of my favourite places in Dublin. It manages to put together great show s where art and science not only mix, but fades together for three months. A truly collaborative enriching experience for both disciplines. This exhibition is my favourite so far, and I wrote about it for my friends at [THE ISSUE][3]. Read the full entry on their website!
