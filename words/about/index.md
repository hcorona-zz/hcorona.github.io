][1]Hi, I am humberto Corona, the author of this blog. I write about  contemporary art, photography, music hacking and recommender systems.  I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University College Dublin, working in the Insight Centre for Data Analytics. I have a twitter account @totopampin.

Other than this blog, I collaborate in [The Issue magazine][2] and [Temps de Vacances magazine][3], both in technical issues and writing invited posts every now and then.
