I know very little before watching [Jean Michael Basquiat][1] (1960 &#8211; 1988) before watching &#8220;[Basquiat][2]&#8220;, the movie about the meteoric rise (and fall) of this american painter. Now that I am writing about him and the movie, I still know very little about him and his work, but I am fascinated.

    New Art, New Money: The Marketing of an American Artist
  </p>
</div>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Starting with empty hands, living in the streets or friends houses, this multifaceted artist became a major success, appearing in the New York Times magazine cover entitledÂ &#8220;New Art, New Money: The Marketing of an American Artist&#8221;. He did graffiti with his friend Al Diaz under the name SAMO, he had a few bands and used to sell postcards to make a living before hitting the galleries, exhibiting his work all over the world.
</p>

The movie is (as far as I can tell) quite an accurate vision of his life, shows how this ambitious and yet naive man made it, enjoyed it and then fell into addiction, shortly after his friend Andy Warhol died. It shows how the art business was ran back then, changing galleries, ascend positions in the social-artist scale while making some people happy and some sad.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">There is very little left to say from be about this great artist, I can only recommend you watch his movie and start researching his work as I have been doing in the past weeks.</span>
