								<h3>Our club</h3>
		
<p>								
The club was founded on May 27, 1913 and immediately affiliated to the Lemster Branch of the Irish Amateur Swimming Asioeiation. It was open to all the students of the College, those who had graduated not more then two years previously, and to all members of the staff. The President was Dr. A.W. Conway, the captain lames Tallon and the secretary A.L Beveridge. </p>

<p>From the beginning it included Water Polo. A Women's Branch soon followed as reported in the NATIONAL STUDENT: "The first meeting of the Women's Branch Ladies Swimming Club took place at Ivcagh Baths on April 30, 1914. The attendance was very promising and at the two subsequent meetings it developed so rapidly that we can now count over 20 active members. The Club meetings take place every Monday and Thursday at lveagh Baths from I I to 12 o'clock. Instruction in the various forms of swimming and diving is given by Miss TempesNcatified teacher and holder of the Diploma in Life Saving. The subscription is only 2/6 and mem-bership is open to all women students and members of the staff. Intending members should send their names and subscriptions as soon as possible to Miss T. Kathleen Kelly, Hon. Sec." A very successful Gala was held in June 1914. The FREE-MAN'S JOURNAL reported that: " It was very apparent that the University College Club will ere long take that prominent place in Irish swimming which should rightly be theirs." The arrangements reflected the highest credit on the secretary, Al Beveridge. In 1916, the club entered the Senior Championship and "did extremely well." Two members were placed in the Pier Race, and at Greystones the Saturday Post Cup was won by J.J. Mooney, who also won the Open 100 yards at the Belvedere Gala.

gr. The year 1925 was the first time that U('D were able to raise a regular junior team. The SPORTS MAIL considered that much of the credit for this was due to the organising ability of R.K. Boylan who spared neither "time nor energy in his effort to keep alive an interest 
.4 ....•sou•u•a6 aims Tv atm rut') ur tot lAIIICge. I Ile same newspaper noted that at the start of the 1929 open air swimming season, held at Dun Laughaire pier. Eddie Heron the Tailteann champion and 11. Walsh of UCD gave fine displays with Walsh winning on his handi-cap of four points. In 1931. the club took part in the English Universities Championships. Their best performance was in the Squadron Race when they beat the previous record but only finished third. It also took part in the Irish Students' Association Gala at Queen's in the follow-ing year. As they were not competing as seniors they did not enter for the water polo events. The spring of 1933 saw them competing against Liverpool University but the results reflected the very poor facilities for winter swimming in Dublin. and Liverpool won easily. Later in the year UCD came second to Trinity in the Leinster Senior Squadron Championship. Membership was increasing rapidly and in 1934 was close on one hundred, with P.J. Hogan as captain. Harry Case the leading coach of the day, was engaged and the club won the Intervarsity Championships, came second to Trinity. very strong indeed at that time. in the Leinster Championships and followed with a reasonable performance in reaching the final of the British Universities Championships, despite the unavailability of M.J. Halton. In March 1935, notices throughout the College invited lady stu-dents to attend a general meeting to establish a Ladies Swimming Club. In its UCD Notes the College correspondent of the IRISH TIMES commented that: "There is undoubtedly room in College for this club, and the wonder is that it had not been formed long ago. The men's club has made a name for the college in the swimming world, and there is no reason why a ladies club should not do the saman It is not clear whether the ladies were dissatisfied with their role as a mere section or whether it had ceased to function somewhere along the line.

SWIMMING In its October issue the NATIONAL STutmiNT repotted that P. Meehan came second in the boyds handicap at the Club Gala -which, considering that I had only just arrived in College, represent-ed. thanks to the efficiency of the Club secretary, fame of a kind in being mentioned in the first number issued during my student days. I can also recall playing in a few, probably a very few. water pol°, matches. It did not seem to me to be my metier. The 100Ye'EA Intervaisity Championship was won by T.W. Bradley. while R. u Brolchain won the 220 and the 100 yds breast stroke In a somewhat severe note the NATIONAL STUDENT had this to say of the Club a year later: "If these notes were to consist solely of an account of the achievements of the club during the past season. they would not make very good reading. lb men who like to hear of College clubs sweeping all before them, the confession that the Swimming Club has for some years played the pail of gallant loser will not be very comforting ... It is unnecessary to make any appeal for members." As a reply, the club won the Junior League and the Junior Water Polo Cup in the following season. By 1938 a junior and an intermedi-ate team were playing in the Water Polo Leagues. There was, howev-er, no joy in the ISA Championships where UCD finished well behind Queen's and Trinity. In 1938, Miss M. Bnmicardi, a prominent member of both the ladies Swimming and Hockey Clubs was elected honorary secretary of the Irish Ladies Swimming Association. In 1939, the final of the Intermediate Water Polo Cup was nar-rowly lost by "a good and evenly balanced team," and in 1940 the polo players went senior which proved to be hard slogging, even if they did reach the-final of the Leinster Cup by defeating Trinity by three goals to nil, a result which a few years previously would have been regarded as a major triumph indeed. A subsequent victory in the Intervarsity Cup showed that it was no flash in the pan. Overall, in the championships, UCD came a close second to Trinity. In October 1940, the club held its Silver Jubilee Gala with, sign of the times, the highlight being a squadron race against the Army. A few weeks later in a match with Queen's the senior events were lost

but the juniors performed well. In the 1941 intervarsity Championships. Queen's dominated once again with College second, and the rest nowhere. M. Feddis won both the High Platform and the Springboard Diving Championships. By now the foray into senior ranks in water polo stems to ha'e ended but at the Club Gala in October the club beat Queen's in die leatere events - the squadron race and water polo. According to the LICD correspondent of the IRISH TIMES, the secretary of the leinster Branch of the 1ASA reported to its Annual General Meeting that UCD was "the most improved club in Leinster." In CO811111011 with almost all the clubs, the war years seem to have been relatively uneventful and by the time it ended two College gen-erations had come and gone. In the 1946 Inter/amities the only UCD winner, in the Diving, was Miss Deirdre Menai°. later to be also prominent in hockey and tennis. Shortly afterwards she came third in the Irish Championships. In the Club Gala at Blackrock the feature was the visit of Belgian visitors. the Royal Verviers Club. Time UCD men, Feddis, Collins and Digby were on a Combined Universities side to play the water polo match. In the event the Belgians swept the board losing only one event. December 1948 saw the election once again of Kevin &Doherty as president. He was the mainstay of the club for many years, in good years and bad, and the club should revere his memory. In the following season P.J. Kavanagh finished second in both the 100 and 400 free-style events to the British Olympic swimmer R. Stedman at (he Universities Athletic Union Swimming Championships in London. In July the I th annual Irish Universities' Swimming Championships were held in Blackrock. UCD had been the holders of the Belton Cup for the past three years - Queen's had held it for the previous six. I. O'Sullivan retained his High Board Diving title and Kavanagh broke the existing record for the 100 metres by almost two seconds In the 1950 Intervarsity, UCD won the water polo, beating TCD, UCC and Queen's on the way. Kavanagh was joined by his brother Ronnie - both of them were later to play rugby for Ireland -in the College team. The Belton Cup was retained and records set up

In May 1954 the Annual Gala was ambitious with teams fromTCD. Queen's. the Army ave and Edinburgh University - who also sent a women's team. This was followed up a year later with a Triangular Gala with Trinity and CD Edinburgh also taking part. In the Irish Universities Championship. also Ronnie Wilson won the metes 200 metre title; the women won the 50 d in metres relay and NI. Woods the 50 metres backstroke. Lure CD i.ties Major General AJ. Beveridge remembered the In February 1960, the IRISH TIMES went back to the beginning of the club with an obituary of one of its founders: "Swimming in UCD !Yin owes a lot to the late Major General Al Beveridge, CBE, who died any in Venice last September. Forty five years ago. mainly through his AMU, a Swimming Club was formed and 1w was the first captain. 100 The club flourished and has made a notable impact on Leicester and tan Irish swimming.... In 1955 Beveridge retired from the Royal Army in Medical Corps after a long and distinguished career and. returning to ing Dublin, resumed his interest in Universities' swimming. He was elect-; of ed President of UCD Swimming Club in 1956 and in honour of this the he presented the Beveridge Shield for indoor water polo competition Ind amongst the universities." The competition had been held four times coo With Queen's successful in all. UCD won the Winter Water Polo League for 1959-60 and three ng members of the team were selected for the Leinster team - Oliver nis Lawless, P. Hyland and J. McKenna. In 1960 the Club again won both - the men's and women's titles at the Universities Championships at up Blaekrock Baths. New records were set by the men's medley

The 1962 season opened with the winning ot the Dublin Senior winter indoor Waterpolo league. In June, in "bitterly add" weather at Blackrock Baths 1.103 won both the men's and women's chance-onships. 411  In 1963, the ladies won again. but the men finished a rim-ners-up to Queen's. and the ladies continued their winning ways in 0 1964; AWAKE pointed out that the Ilegany sisters were outstanding S Patricia set a new record in the 100m breast stroke, while Noah won the 200m. AWAKE again congratulated the club as both UCD teams were very successful at the Irish Universities Swimming Championships of 1967. The ladies won their section on an overall points basis from Queen's and Trinity, while the men won seven of the nine titks * stake. Irish international Denis O'Dea was College's top pedaloes. winning three individual titles as well as being a member of two sac-cessful relay teams. Other winners were D. Lavin. J. Meade. N. Smith, D. Carney and 0. Corrigan. In 1968, P. Ilegarty and P. O'Neill on the women's team and!). Lavin on the men's were on the Irish Universities team for a triangu-lar match against the English and the Scottish Universities. The women's team then won the Irish Intervarsity Championships. O. Lavin was the only player selected for the Lcinster water polo team against Ulster. The 1970s saw the ladies dominating Intervarsity competition for seven successive years. Vicky Smith represented Ireland and Aisling O'Leary was on the Irish team at the Munich Olympics in 1972. In 1976-77 both men and women won the Intervarsities but UCD NEWS reported that the club found little consolation in the fact that most of the Irish under-21 water polo squad and several interna-tional swimmers were in College. Poor facilities were blamed for the fact that College was deprived of the services of many of these in

C. O'Leary, A. Morrison and E. Coggin tg won the three ladies loom events and also the Medley Relay. T-18 Connolly and B. Conroy won men's events. The men won the Intervarsity in 1979 following a run of successes by the ladies. re With the opening of the Sports Centre and its vastly increased rf opportunities for College sportsmen and, increasingly, sportswomen, the question of a 50 metre swimming pool came under discussion in it a more urgent form. Obviously, hopes were high that the pool, which had been increasingly talked about, would be built at Belfield where both space and facilities were readily available and, in spite of the enormous cost and all the others difficulties associated with the main-tenance of such a pool, would probably have been welcomed by the powers that be. There certainly were discussions then and since; few of the participants would have thought that nothing would have hap-pened by the mid-nineties. -In 1983, the club delivered what the UCD NEWS described as the "Grand Slam" in swimming and water-polo. In 1985, six swim-mers were! on the Irish Universities squad against Scotland - Dermot Hughes, Joseph O'Dea, Maurice Linnane, Susan Linnane, Maya Butterfield, and Ciaran O'Driscoll - President of the Irish Universities Swimming Association. At the 1987 Intervarsity Water Polo Championships in Galway, the men's team produced what the IRISH PRFSS described as a "minor upset" by beating Queen's 7-5 in the final. The scores for College were P. Hogan (3), P.O'Shea (2) and J. O'Dea and M. Kelly, one each. 

ST. rATRILICS KM AND SAFFRON In January 5988. the IRISH PRESS reported That Gary O'Toole had taken a year's leave from his studies to prepare himself full-time for the Olympics. In August 1989, he was said to have -shocked the swimming world.... 'by winning the silver medal in a world class field at the European Championships at Bonn. In the 1989 Intervarsitics, the men beat Trinity in the final of the water polo and the women's team won the Plate. In international competition, Gary O'Toole and Declan Byrne competed in the World Student Gaines at Sheffield. A year later the Life Saving Intervantity was annexed and Annc Hudson won the I.iffey Swim. In 1993 a sizeable contingent was selected for tlw Dublin Colleges Squad for competitions in Brussels and Amsterdam. Those selected were Rachel Egan, Fiona Hood, Aiden Byrne. Conor Kelly, Stephen Kelly. David Smylie and Anthony Sweetman. In 1995. the Colours was won as was the life Saving Intervarsity. Intervarsity Freshers' competitions are of considerable signifi-Mince for the future of any club and a good Omen was the success of the club in the Irish Universities Freshers Championship Gala. We can end with the names of those who were selected on the Irish Universities squad which won the Home Nations Championships in Limerick. In swimming those selected were Ciaran Byrne, Cliona Redmond. Sarah Keane, Aldan Byrne. DecIan Byrne and Caroline McKay. In Water Polo our representatives were Cliona Redmond, Pauline McDermott. Sarah Keane, Oonagh McGale. Barbara Keane, Carol Leonard, Helen Keane, David Smylie. Eoin McNamara and Graham Roche.
