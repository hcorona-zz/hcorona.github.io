  From strangers to lust as fast as we could,<br /> from endless conversations to  unequivocal love,<br /> <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">from lovers to completing each other,<br /> from lust to imperative necessity, to </span>routine<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">.</span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  From lovers to strangers even faster,<br /> as if everything we lived had to be removed in order to live,<br /> from endless conversations to monosyllables,<br /> from lust do indifference, to being unknown,<br /> from completeness to the crude emptiness that evolves me.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  From strangers to lovers and return, over and over again.<br /> Different faces telling the same stories,<br /> falling and failing in the pursue of an ephemeral happiness.<br /> I am not content.
