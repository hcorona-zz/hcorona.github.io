    <h2 class="post-title">On references, change and standardisation</h2>

  </header>

  <section class="style4 wrapper container">
    <p>In the last week I wasted half a day fixing citations for a journal paper. HALF-A-DAY that I could have spent doing actual research! Here is what we should do about it.</p>

<p>The way we write and use references should change. Drastically. Several standards have been popping in and out for more than 100 years (the Chicago style dates 1906) … there was no internet, telephone or commercial planes back then! This was when you mailed your scientific papers to your colleagues so they could read it. This was when you received copies of journals by the mail. Oops, we still do, right?</p>

<p>In the last 100 years things have changed. In the last 20 years things have changed. In the last 2 years things have probably changed more than in the previous 20! Yet we, people who do research, still use the same format for citations. To me, it makes no sense!</p>

<p>First, there is all the fields for a reference. Authors, title of the paper, title of the conference (or journal), volume, edition, pages, publisher etc… When was the last time you searched through an actual book of proceedings to find a paper and found the paper you were looking for in pages 34-46? NEVER! If I can not google it, chances are I will not be reading that paper. I use google scholar to search for papers, and I read and annotate papers on my iPad.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it make more sense to have a reference that includes authors, title of the paper and a unique identifier for it, which would also serve as a URL (DOI, arxiv, are good examples). That url would also serve as a metadata source for the reference. Therefore, the tedious job of fixing typos on the references would be gone! Plus you can just click on it and go to the next paper … easy, right?</p>

<p>Then there is the problem of standardisation. Who needs 30 different styles for citations! Dear people who edit conferences and journal proceedings, my life would be easier if there were only 2,3, or even 5 (if you really need them) styles that are very well known, and that’s it! I personally like numbers, but I get other styles such as [name, year] are very elegant, but no one cares if you use a comma or a period as separators, if you have quotations in the title of the paper, if you have the year before or after the title … because 90% of the time I just need the title to google it!</p>

<p>If we standardise the formatting to 2 styles (one column, two columns) we can all focus on the content, and leave aside other things. It would also be easier to scan thought papers.</p>

<p>What about the tools we use? Last week my friend was copy-pasting references into a .bib file manually, like it was 1995! And to be honest, sometimes I also need to do it because there is no other way around it. I know Mendeley helped a lot there, but we are nowhere close to where we should be. The metadata (that I find completely useless unless I am writing a paper and need to include it) is never correct, and you often need to fix it – a job that no one likes, a waste of time.</p>

<p>Having less complex citation styles and heavily standardising them would only lead to less time spent on that and more on the actual problems we want to solve. I would also lead to a lot of new tools built upon that. Imagine how easy would it be to find citations if there was a unique url on the actual paper. Avoid duplicates, better citation counts, easier cross-references, higher availability of the content… the opportunities are endless!</p>

<p>How do I make this happen?</p>
