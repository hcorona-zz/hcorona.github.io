  There was  a time where we could speak clear.<br /> I used to tell you almost everything.<br /> Words would flow from my brain to my mouth without a filter,<br /> Now a big filter keeps me from even speaking,<br /> mainly because I loved you. Sometimes because I was sad, happy or angry.<br /> it is there to protect you, protect me, and because it has to be like this.
