    <p>If I had to describe beauty, it would not be far away from [Mies van der Rohe][1], since I visited the [Barcelona pavilion][2] and became aware of his legacy, I have been fascinated. Almost every decent office business in the world has a [Barcelona chair][3], a timeless piece originally designed in 1929.</p>

<p>Once of Mies’ first commissions was the [Villa Tugendhat][4], a small villa designed for the daughter of a wealthy textile family in Brno. The house could easily have been designed this year, its pure lines and technical constructions methods are perfect.</p>

<p>But in fact, I’d like to talk about the documentary “[Haus Tugendhat][5]“, which I saw in the Jameson international Film Festival. After this saturday’s projection, this villa means something else to me. A mix of History, life, family, joy, but also prosecution or spoilage …</p>

<p>The documentary Haus Tugendhat (directed by [Dieter Reifarth][6]) research the life behind this precious architectural piece of the XX century. From their first inhabitants, the Tugendhat family, which had to run away from the nazi prosecution, to the patients recovering there from spinal injuries as childrens in the comunist checoslovaquia, I saw the house as a history more than a simple place. There was a connection between the people and the haus tugendhat, it made me realize how people connect to the places where they live, and they associate memories to them. Yet most of the people who lived in the house was unaware of its architecturally importance.</p>

<p>An interesting topic which was discussed in the movie is the current state of the haus tugendhat. After years of deterioration and (part) of the Tugendhat family trying to recover it, now the house has been restored to its original state, mock-up furniture replaced the originals designed by Mies and Lilly Reich (some pieces specifically designed for the villa are still in production) and it is part of the [unesco world heritage][8], yet it feels that the house has lost more than 50 years of history in the process. All the marks, stories and changes made by its inhabitants are now lost, and it is reduced to a huge doll house for us to be seen but not touched.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>We were lucky to have Michael Guggenheim (grandson of the original inhabitants and comissioners) as a guest for a Q&amp;A session. I asked him what was the family’s opinion on the current state of the house, to what he answerded me that as in every family, there were different points of view. Thus, its only living original inhabitant, the philosopher Ernst Tugendhadt said he just doesn’t care. I somehow understood a position of a man whom as a kid lived in a house which was way ahead of its time, had to run away from the nazi prosecution and ended up living in many different countries and houses.</p>

<p>I’d love to say more about the house, or the movie. But once the introductions have been made, I rather have you exploring by yourself than be guided into my biased views.</p>
