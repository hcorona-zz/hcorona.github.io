        <p>A day in London can start in countless ways. Mine started being woken up by a guy snoring in the bunk-bed next to mine on a cheap hostel near South Kensington; the perks of low budget accommodation! However, things turned on my side very soon when I left my bed, quickly dressed up and started exploring the streets of this beautiful neighbourhood where you find all the cool shops where you can&#8217;t afford buying anything.</p>

<p>My initial idea was to head to <a href="http://www.simonleegallery.com/">Simon Lee gallery</a> to get a few of the <a href="http://larryclark.com/">Larry Clark</a> photographs being sold for 100£ that week, in a similar fashion than the initial sale at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/09/arts/design/larry-clark-sells-snapshots-for-100-each.html">home alone 2</a> gallery in New York.  So  there I headed, browsed trough thousand of original 10&#8243;x6&#8243; prints and selected one. Larry Clark, forever young at his 70s said <em>&#8220;This is a payback to all the skate rats and collectors who would like a souvenir, so I can die happy&#8221;. *Well Larry, i got one and I&#8217;m happy but this is far from a souvenir for me.</em><br>

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    The show attracted quite some people, not as many as the thousand of photographs
  </p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Turns out the neighbourhood has a few other galleries (so the rich people who live in the area can buy art on the weekends) and I went to a few of them.</p>

<p>First I visited a really interesting small exhibition (from two huge artist) entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.ordovasart.com/exhibitions/chillida-miro/images.html">Chillida On Miró</a>&#8221; at the ORDOVAS gallery. It was very interesting to see the collaboration of works produced by these two artists, who were good  friends and spent the summers of the 60s together with their families in France.</p>

  <p class="wp-caption-text">

  </p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then I headed to the <a href="http://flemingcollection.com/">Flemming Collection</a>, where an exhibition about Sctotish photographer Petter Cattrell entitled <a href="http://flemingcollection.com/traces-of-war-landscapes-of-the-western-front/">&#8220;Traces of War&#8221;</a> was showing. It was interesting, however I particularly liked a small section that was accompanying the main exhibition about women workers in Scotland during the first world war photographed by <a href="http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/artists-a-z/l/artist/george-p-lewis">George P Lewis</a>. The photographs were commissioned for the imperial war museum in 1918 and show beautiful portrait of women working in the industry, a piece of history that is often overlooked. Very interesting to see if you are around!</p>

<p>Just around the corner from the previous gallery, <a href="http://www.hauserwirth.com/">Hauser&amp;Wirth</a> had a really cool exhibition about the North American artist <a href="http://www.hauserwirth.com/artists/15/richard-jackson/biography/">Richard Jackson</a>. I hadn&#8217;t heard of him until then (yup, never ever), but I was positively surprised and it definetly captured my attention. His work, which combines painting, installation and sculpture is very visual and straightforward. I can&#8217;t say much about the work but rather show you a few of the snaps I took. The gallery was also showing some interesting drawing work by the British artist <a href="http://www.hauserwirth.com/artists/50/phyllida-barlow/biography/">Phyllida Barlow</a>.</p>

<p>Last and best for me, I attended the <a href="http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/marina-abramovic-512-hours">512</a> performance by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Abramovi%C4%87">Marina Abramovic</a>. I t is  performance where for six days a week, eight hours a day Marina is performing her piece with 160 persons at a time. You are invited to come but you can leave whenever you want!</p>

<p>When I say attend and not see it is because you don&#8217;t see it. Once you enter you are a vital part of the performance, as important as the artist herself. Having seen the documentary on her major retrospective artist in presence and some other small exhibitions in Madrid.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t explain the performance, which is held in the serpentine gallery until x august but rather explain what I experienced. First, the performance is carried out in total silence, and the visitor is welcomed to participate i na series of excersices which have been designed by the artist and her collaborators. It felt really good to be part of it, and at the same time I felt completely free and relaxed to do whatever I wanted to do withing the constrains given. A must if you are in London, and even better there were no queues!<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> </span></p>

<div id="attachment_243" style="width: 430px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    The only thing you will see of the exhibition until you actually get to go
  </p>
</div>

<p>Yeah, I also visited the TATE modern and liked their exhibition about <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks?sid=3501">structure and clarity</a> which shows some interesting minimalist works that I saw in 20 minutes as they were kicking me out. It would be nice that museums opened for longer in London, but now I have a good excuse to go back.</p>
