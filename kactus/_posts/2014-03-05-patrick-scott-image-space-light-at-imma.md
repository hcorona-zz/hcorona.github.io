A few weeks ago I went to the [IMMA][1] to see their new exhibition. A retrospective about the irish painter and architect [Patrick Scott][2].  I admit this is my favourite exhibition at the museum so far, and I am lucky because I discovered an irish gem, an unknown artist for me which surprised me greatly.

The exhibition is not held in IMMAs newly renovated main building, but in the small house next to it. It is organised in three different floors and the exhibitions flows from Scott&#8217;s early career, where most of the word is commissioned for advertisement and textile prints, to a few different periods ending with his latest work, with the very define aesthetics he is associated with; gold over a tempura background using different geometric constructions.

He had a prolific career: he exhibit in the MoMa in New York, won the Guggenheim Award in 1960, represented Ireland in the 1960 Venice Biennale and participated in the construction of one Irelands most famous buildings, the [Busáras bus station][3]. Patrick Scott passed away two day before his opening at the age of 93,  yet he lives through his work, like a few other lucky ones.
