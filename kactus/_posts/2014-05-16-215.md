  Nothing is infinite.<br /> Not the Sea, not the Sun.<br /> Not the soil we stand on.<br /> Not the life, not the laugh,<br /> Not your smile.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Not even our sorrow is infinite.<br /> Not our happiness.<br /> Not the truth or the lies,<br /> nor the death.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Not the love or the hate,<br /> not me and you.<br /> Not this.
</p>
